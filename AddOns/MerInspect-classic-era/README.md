# MerInspect-classic-era
I would like to introduce the folk version of TinyInspect Classic which is designed to fix errors in the classic era.

The reason for creating this project is due to the fact that the current TinyInspect Classic has not been updated since 2019, and the addon doesn't work properly in Classic.

This repo is the source code of the Curseforge Addon [MerInspect classic era](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/merinspect-classic-era/)

The original addon is here [TinyInspect](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemlevel-anywhere)
