- Added new tags to readme file.  
- Forgot to bump the version before releasing this update.  
- - Adjusted some of the friends data for SL so we shouldn't show the wrong information at the wrong places anymore.  
    - Added inverse logic blocks like `[if~=noteText]Person has no note text[/if]` and the contents would only show if `noteText` tag was empty.  
    - Added the tag `battleTagName` that only shows the first part of the battle tag so "Ola#1234" becomes "Ola".  
    - Added limited support for `race` for your character friends, it's not originally a variable from the API, but figured I could try add it in case someone was missing that information.
