[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/compare/r723...r725) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/releases)

- readd project IDs so it can actually package  
- Remove Burning Crusade mods (#147)  
- Split .pkgmeta by release type  
    This seems to be the only way to fully exclude a whole addon from  
    release builds.

- Add test for Atal'arion mod  
- Add basic vscode config  
- Upgrade LuaLS and use multi-threaded checking

    Similar skull/bones texture but slightly more visible than the previous

- Update koKR (BCVanilla) (#144)  
- Fixed bad arg position for option default on Chromaggus and Talon Guards
