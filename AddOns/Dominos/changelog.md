### THIS IS A MAJOR BREAKING UPDATE

Action Buttons in retail are no longer derived from ActionBarButtonTemplate. The behavior
in classic should be about the same as it was before.

Benefits:

* You'll (hopefully) no longer see cases where action buttons would randomly stop working when switching zones.
* Generally action button behavior should be more consistent across all action buttons

Drawbacks:

* Press and hold casting is no longer supported. (This is an API limitation of using completely custom action buttons)
* Addons that modify the stock action won't just work with Dominos anymore. They'll need to code in their own support
  (sorry).

Other Changes:

* (Retail) Out of range coloring is now builtin
* (Retail) Spell activation glows can now be disabled. They're also a bit less dramatic.
